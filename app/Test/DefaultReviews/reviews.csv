1,1,"Found this hotel by reading over tripadvisor while planning a little beach getaway. Really good price by the beach. James the front desk manager was really fun, he made our stay more fun than we thought it would be. We are going to come back with our friends soon."
1,2,"Across the road from Santa Monica Pier is exactly where you want to be when visiting Santa Monica, as well as not far from lots of shops and restaurants/bars. Hotel itself is very new & modern, rooms were great. Comfortable beds & possibly the best shower ever!"
1,3,"I have stayed here 4 or 5 times while visiting LA. Despite travelling all over the world and staying in some of the best international hotels ( for work), Hotel Caliornia is one of my absolute favourites. Perfect location, right on the beach. I love the way you can just open your door and be outside, no elevators, corridors big glass windows. The ambience is so nice, retro perfect. As for the staff, I have had consistently superb service, with much more personal service and attention to detail than is usual in bigger hotels. Aaron and Katy were just two who have been exemplary this time but really everyone is terrific. Can't recommend it highly enough."
1,4,"Terrible. Old, not quite clean. Lost my reservation, then ""found"" a smaller room, for the same price, of course. Noisy. Absolutely no parking, unless you luck out for the $10 spaces (of which there are 12). Water in bathroom sink would not turn off. Not hair dryer, no iron in room. Miniscule shower- better be thin to use it!"
1,5,I was excited to stay at this Hotel. It looked cute and was reasonable.  It turned out to be terrible. We were woken up both mornings at 5:45 AM by noisy neighbors. The shower was clogged up...the room was sooooo small we kept tripping over each other. The saving grace was the pool at the Loews next door. I wish we had paid an extra $50 and stayed at a nicer place. This motel should cost no more than $99 a night.
2,1,"Walked in with lady friend for lunch. Hadn't booked. But nice friendly welcome. Pleasant olde worlde place. My friend ordered venison. I ordered something else. But after a while changed my mind and asked for venison too. No problem at all ! Good ! Food was delicious, though for a man a little 'nouvelle cuisine' - and vegs are pretty..."
2,2,"My husband and I chose The Yew Tree Inn for a three night stay when we visited surrounding landmarks this September. We came to the Inn after a long flight from the U.S. and were extremely tired. They fixed us a pot of tea and got our room prepared as fast as possible as we were there before their official..."
2,3,"The pub has plenty of parking, is easy to find and has a welcoming atmosphere. The interior is of the pleasant low-beamed variety. Food was just above average, but nothing to justify a reputation. The 'feel' and the staff are what lifts this place. Some dislike the road noise. I definitely didn't like the ground floor cell I was in"
2,4,"I recently stumbled across the Yew Tree Inn's website and the photos looked fantastic. The reality of the place really delivered - lots of nooks and crannies, big old open fireplace with a roaring fire and great ales on tap. The owner was extremely welcoming and dog friendly and so it was very easy to settle in to the place"
2,5,"terrible, small! Definitely not worth the money. Hotel itself is clean, tidy, but is a bit out of the way so we had to call a taxi to go anywhere. If there were buses, no one mentioned them. Room was okay but we heard every noise from other guests opening doors, walking down the corridors etc. Beds were like a"
